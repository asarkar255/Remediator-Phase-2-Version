Rule 1: General Remediation Instructions for ABAP Code
God Rule is our bible.
Description:
- Review and apply every rule with the highest priority.
- Only return the remediated (corrected) ABAP code; do not return original/incorrect code without comments.
- Prioritize LLM's knowledge of ECC and S/4 HANA ABAP standards above all.
- Always comment out the original (non-S/4 HANA compliant) ABAP code.
- This approach applies universally to all statements and codes that require remediation.
- The remediated (corrected) code must be inserted immediately after the commented-out incorrect code.
- Always include the Rule Number after the comment tags '"Commented By PwA' and '"Added By PwA'.
- 'ORDER BY' rule No 12 is getting missed in your remediation everytime please include this on high priority.
- 'INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE' is missed in your remediation most of the time please include this on high priority.
Example:

Input (Original Code):
DATA: BEGIN OF itab OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,
        matnr TYPE matnr,
        vbeln TYPE vbeln_d,
      END OF itab.

Output (Remediated Code):
*DATA: BEGIN OF itab OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,   "Commented By PwA Rule X
*        matnr TYPE matnr,
*        vbeln TYPE vbeln_d,
*END OF itab.

TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_itab,                          "Added By PwA Rule X
         matnr TYPE matnr,
         vbeln TYPE vbeln_d,
       END OF ty_itab.

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| Encounter legacy ABAP code incompatible with S/4 HANA | Comment the old code and add the remediated code immediately after |
| Tagging | Always mention Rule Number in comments |

Rule 2: Replace DATA Declaration with OCCURS 0 and HEADER LINE Using TYPES and Separate Work Area

Description:
- If a DATA declaration uses "BEGIN OF XXXX OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE", replace it with:
  - A TYPES structure for the line type.
  - An internal table declaration using STANDARD/HASHED/INDEXED table without HEADER LINE.
  - A separate work area declaration of the same TYPE.
- Ensure transformation to modern ABAP standards for S/4 HANA compatibility.
- Always comment out the original code and add the remediated version just after it.
- Always include the Rule Number in the comments.

Example 1:

Input:
DATA: BEGIN OF itab OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,
        matnr TYPE matnr,
        vbeln TYPE vbeln_d,
      END OF itab.

Rule 3: Replace SELECT * with Explicit Field Selection

Description:
- If SELECT * is found in the input ABAP code:
  - Identify all fields required from the database table.
  - Explicitly list the necessary fields in the SELECT statement instead of using '*'.
  - Use internal tables and work areas declared as per Rule 2.
  - Always escape internal table and WHERE clause variables using '@' for S/4 HANA compatibility.
- Comment out the original SELECT * code.
- Add remediated code with explicit fields and modern syntax.

Example 1:

Input:
Select *
  FROM bseg 
  INTO TABLE ibseg[]
  WHERE belnr IN s_belnr[].

Output:
*Select *                     "Commented By PwA  Rule 3
*  FROM bseg 
*  INTO TABLE ibseg[]
*  WHERE belnr IN s_belnr[].

  FROM bseg
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @ibseg
  WHERE belnr IN @s_belnr.

Example 2:

Input:
Select *
  FROM bkpf 
  INTO TABLE ibkpf[]
  WHERE belnr IN s_belnr[].
IF ibkpf[] IS NOT INITIAL.
Select *
  FROM bseg 
  INTO TABLE ibseg[]
  FOR ALL ENTRIES IN ibkpf[]
  WHERE belnr IN s_belnr[].
ENDIF.

Output:
*Select *                       "Commented By PwA  Rule 3

*IF ibkpf[] IS NOT INITIAL.
*Select *                        "Commented By PwA  Rule 3
*  FROM bseg 
*  INTO TABLE ibseg[]
*  FOR ALL ENTRIES IN ibkpf[]
*  WHERE belnr IN s_belnr[].
*ENDIF.

Select bukrs, belnr                                   "Added By PwA  Rule 3
  FROM bkpf
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE @ibkpf
  WHERE belnr IN @s_belnr[].
IF ibkpf IS NOT INITIAL.
Select bukrs, belnr, koart                              "Added By PwA  Rule 3

Rule 12: Add ORDER BY or SORT After Database Selection

Description:
- After a database SELECT INTO TABLE, if no SORT is performed on the internal table, ensure the selected data is ordered.
- If the SELECT does NOT use FOR ALL ENTRIES, add an ORDER BY clause in the SELECT statement.
- If the SELECT uses FOR ALL ENTRIES, do NOT use ORDER BY. Instead, add a SORT statement on the internal table after data retrieval.

Example 1: No FOR ALL ENTRIES — Use ORDER BY

Input (Original Code):
SELECT knumv 
       kposn  
       stunr
       zahek
 FROM  KONV
 INTO TABLE lt_KONV 
 WHERE KNUMV IN S_KNUMV.
IF sy-subrc = 0.
ENDIF.

Output (Remediated Code):
*SELECT knumv     "Commented By PwA Rule 12
*      kposn  
*      stunr
*      zahek
*FROM  KONV
*INTO TABLE lt_KONV 
*WHERE KNUMV IN S_KNUMV.
*IF sy-subrc = 0.
*ENDIF.

SELECT knumv     
       kposn  
       stunr
       zahek
 FROM  V_KONV                          "Added By PwA Rule 12
 INTO TABLE lt_KONV 
 WHERE KNUMV IN S_KNUMV
 ORDER BY knumv kposn stunr zahek.      "Added By PwA Rule 12
IF sy-subrc = 0.
ENDIF.


Example 2: With FOR ALL ENTRIES — Use SORT

Input (Original Code):
SELECT knumv 
       kposn  
       stunr
       zahek
 FROM  KONV
 INTO TABLE lt_KONV 
 FOR ALL ENTRIES IN lt_final
 WHERE stunr = lt_final-stunr
   AND KNUMV IN S_KNUMV.
IF sy-subrc = 0.
ENDIF.

Output (Remediated Code):
*SELECT knumv                           "Commented By PwA Rule 12
*      kposn  
*      stunr
*      zahek
*FROM  KONV
*INTO TABLE lt_KONV 
*FOR ALL ENTRIES IN lt_final
*WHERE stunr = lt_final-stunr
*  AND KNUMV IN S_KNUMV.
*IF sy-subrc = 0.
*ENDIF.

SELECT knumv

ENDIF.


Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| Simple SELECT without FOR ALL ENTRIES | Add ORDER BY fields in SELECT statement |
| SELECT with FOR ALL ENTRIES | After SELECT, add SORT on internal table |

Rule 13: Replace READ TABLE on Internal Tables with Header Line by Using Work Areas

Description:
- If an internal table with a HEADER LINE is used with a READ TABLE statement, it must be modernized.
- Create a proper TYPES structure and define an internal table and corresponding work area separately.
- Use the work area explicitly in the READ TABLE statement to avoid outdated header-line usage.

Rule 14: ABAP Declarations Syntax and Formatting Rules

A. TYPES Declaration:
   - Always begin a TYPES block with "TYPES: BEGIN OF <type_name>,".
   - Each field must end with a comma ',' (except the last field).
   - End the block with "END OF <type_name>."
   - Always terminate the TYPES block with a period '.' after END OF.
   
   Example:
   TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_mara,
            matnr TYPE matnr,
            werks TYPE werks_d,
            lgort TYPE lgort_d,
          END OF ty_mara.

B. DATA Declaration:
   - For a structure or a single variable, declare as:
     "DATA <variable_name> TYPE <type_name>."
   - For internal tables, declare as:
     "DATA <table_name> TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF <type_name> WITH DEFAULT KEY."
   - End every DATA statement with a period '.'.

   Example (Single Field):
   DATA lv_matnr TYPE matnr.

   Example (Internal Table):
   DATA lt_mara TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_mara WITH DEFAULT KEY.

   Example (Work Area):
   DATA ls_mara TYPE ty_mara.

C. Comma Usage:
   - Within a TYPES block, all field lines must end with a comma ','
     except the final field before END OF.
   - No comma ',' after END OF.

D. Period Usage:
   - Every ABAP statement must end with a period '.' (outside of TYPES field list).
   - Mandatory after END OF, DATA, and standalone executable statements.

E. Indentation and Formatting:
   - Begin TYPES declaration at standard indentation.
   - Indent fields inside TYPES block by 2 spaces or 1 tab.
   - Indent multi-line DATA declarations properly for better readability.

F. Naming Conventions (Best Practices):
   - Prefix local variables with 'lv_' (e.g., lv_matnr).
   - Prefix structures (single line) with 'ls_' (e.g., ls_mara).
   - Prefix internal tables with 'lt_' (e.g., lt_mara).
   - Prefix global variables with 'gv_' if needed.
   - Prefix constants with 'gc_'.
   - Prefix parameters with 'p_' or 's_' (for SELECT-OPTIONS).
   - Prefix work areas derived from TABLES with 'gs_'.

G. Additional Syntax Rules:
   - Never mix declarations and operations; keep them in separate blocks.
   - Always declare TYPES first, then DATA, then CONSTANTS (if any), before executable logic.
   - Prefer explicit type references (TYPE) over implicit ones (LIKE).

H. Standard Example:

TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_employee,
         empid TYPE empid,
         name TYPE name1,
         doj TYPE datum,
       END OF ty_employee.

DATA lt_employee TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF ty_employee WITH DEFAULT KEY.
DATA ls_employee TYPE ty_employee.
DATA lv_count TYPE i.

CLEAR lt_employee.

Rule 15: Handle MATNR Extension in S/4HANA System

Description:
- In S/4HANA, the material number field MATNR has been extended from 18 to 40 characters.
- All data declarations, comparisons, and assignments involving MATNR must be updated accordingly.
- Avoid using hardcoded character length (e.g., `C LENGTH 18`) for material numbers.
- Always use TYPE matnr for MATNR-related variables to adapt automatically to the new length.

Best Practices:
- Use `TYPE matnr` instead of `TYPE C LENGTH 18` or `LIKE mara-matnr`.
- Ensure alignment in structures, internal tables, and variables using MATNR.
- Validate any custom logic relying on material number formatting or padding.

Example 1:

Input:
DATA lv_matnr TYPE C LENGTH 18.

Output:
*DATA lv_matnr TYPE C LENGTH 18.         "Commented By PwA  Rule 15
DATA lv_matnr TYPE matnr.                "Added By PwA  Rule 15

Example 2:

Input:
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_mat,
         matnr TYPE c LENGTH 18,
         maktx TYPE maktx,
       END OF ty_mat.

Output:
*TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_mat,                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 15
*         matnr TYPE c LENGTH 18,
*         maktx TYPE maktx,
*       END OF ty_mat.

TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_mat,                  "Added By PwA  Rule 15
         matnr TYPE matnr,
         maktx TYPE maktx,
       END OF ty_mat.


Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| MATNR defined as C LENGTH 18 or LIKE | Replace with TYPE matnr |
| Commenting | Comment old declarations and add corrected versions using matnr domain |
| Compatibility | Ensures 40-character readiness for S/4HANA |

---

Rule 16: Replace ADD and SUBTRACT with Inline Arithmetic in S/4HANA

Description:
- In S/4HANA, usage of legacy arithmetic statements like ADD and SUBTRACT is discouraged.
- Prefer using inline arithmetic with '=' assignment for better readability and performance.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  ADD a TO b.                =>  b = b + a.
  SUBTRACT a FROM b.         =>  b = b - a.
- Always comment out the old statement and insert the new inline operation after it.
- Apply this across all numeric operations for consistency.

Example 1: ADD

Input:
ADD lv_value TO lv_total.

Output:
*ADD lv_value TO lv_total.            "Commented By PwA  Rule 16
lv_total = lv_total + lv_value.       "Added By PwA  Rule 16

Example 2: SUBTRACT

Input:
SUBTRACT lv_discount FROM lv_price.

Output:
*SUBTRACT lv_discount FROM lv_price.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 16
lv_price = lv_price - lv_discount.    "Added By PwA  Rule 16

Example 3: Multiple ADDs

Input:
ADD lv_a TO lv_sum.
ADD lv_b TO lv_sum.

Output:
*ADD lv_a TO lv_sum.                  "Commented By PwA  Rule 16
lv_sum = lv_sum + lv_a.              "Added By PwA  Rule 16
*ADD lv_b TO lv_sum.                  "Commented By PwA  Rule 16
lv_sum = lv_sum + lv_b.              "Added By PwA  Rule 16

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| ADD found | Replace with b = b + a |
| SUBTRACT found | Replace with b = b - a |
| Commenting | Always comment original ADD/SUBTRACT and use inline assignment |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---

Rule 17: Use RANGES with Explicit TYPE Declaration in S/4HANA

Description:
- In S/4HANA, avoid using implicit RANGES type declarations without structure.
- Always declare RANGES using explicit TYPE RANGE OF <data_element>.
- Avoid legacy usage like RANGES <name> FOR <table-field> without type safety.
- Properly define RANGES with DATA: <name> TYPE RANGE OF <data_element> for clarity and alignment with CDS & AMDP patterns.
- Always declare a work area TYPE LINE OF <range_table> for use in LOOP and APPEND operations.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  RANGES: r_matnr FOR mara-matnr.
  With:
  DATA: r_matnr TYPE RANGE OF matnr.
  DATA: wa_matnr LIKE LINE OF r_matnr.

- Also ensure SELECT statements using RANGES are escaped using '@' for variables.

Example 1:

Input:
RANGES: r_matnr FOR mara-matnr.

Output:
*RANGES: r_matnr FOR mara-matnr.                   "Commented By PwA  Rule 17
DATA: r_matnr TYPE RANGE OF matnr.                 "Added By PwA  Rule 17
DATA: wa_matnr LIKE LINE OF r_matnr.               "Added By PwA  Rule 17

Example 2:

Input:
SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_mara WHERE matnr IN r_matnr.

Output:
*SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_mara WHERE matnr IN r_matnr.     "Commented By PwA  Rule 17
SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_mara WHERE matnr IN @r_matnr.     "Added By PwA  Rule 17

Example 3: LOOP + APPEND for RANGES

Input:
LOOP AT s_matnr INTO wa_matnr.
  APPEND wa_matnr TO r_matnr.
ENDLOOP.

Output:
*LOOP AT s_matnr INTO wa_matnr.                      "Commented By PwA  Rule 17
*  APPEND wa_matnr TO r_matnr.                       "Commented By PwA  Rule 17
*ENDLOOP.                                            "Commented By PwA  Rule 17

LOOP AT s_matnr INTO DATA(ls_matnr).                "Added By PwA  Rule 17
  APPEND ls_matnr TO r_matnr.                       "Added By PwA  Rule 17
ENDLOOP.                                            "Added By PwA  Rule 17

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| RANGES using FOR table-field | Replace with DATA <name> TYPE RANGE OF <data_element> |
| Work area usage for RANGES | Declare DATA <wa_name> LIKE LINE OF <range_table> |
| SELECT using RANGES | Escape RANGES variable with '@' |
| LOOP/APPEND for RANGES | Replace with modern DATA(...) inline syntax |
| Commenting | Always comment old RANGES/LOOP/APPEND and add modern replacement |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---

Rule 18: Replace LIKE LINE OF with TYPE LINE OF

Description:
- Avoid using 'LIKE LINE OF' to declare work areas from internal tables.
- Always use the modern 'TYPE LINE OF' syntax for clarity and consistency.
- This ensures type-safety and better readability, especially for S/4HANA and CDS-based development.
- Also avoid referencing the internal table directly in declarations when a TYPE exists.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  DATA wa_matnr LIKE LINE OF it_matnr.
  With:
  DATA wa_matnr TYPE  ty_matnr.

- Use structured TYPES and refer to internal table type consistently across modules.

Example 1:

Input:
DATA wa_matnr LIKE LINE OF it_matnr.

Output:
*DATA wa_matnr LIKE LINE OF it_matnr.       "Commented By PwA  Rule 18
DATA wa_matnr TYPE  ty_matnr.        "Added By PwA  Rule 18

Example 2:

Input:
DATA: lt_mara TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF mara,
      wa_mara LIKE LINE OF lt_mara.

Output:
DATA: lt_mara TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF mara.
*DATA wa_mara LIKE LINE OF lt_mara.         "Commented By PwA  Rule 18
DATA wa_mara TYPE mara.          "Added By PwA  Rule 18

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| Work area declared with LIKE LINE OF | Replace with TYPE LINE OF syntax |
| Commenting | Comment old LIKE LINE OF declaration and add corrected TYPE LINE OF version |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---
Rule 19: Replace CONDENSE Statement with condense( ) Functional Expression

Description:
- Instead of using the procedural CONDENSE statement, use the functional form condense( ) in S/4HANA and modern ABAP.
- This enhances readability, enables inline operations, and supports expressions in VALUE, LOOP, and RETURN contexts.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  CONDENSE lv_string.
  With:
  lv_string = condense( lv_string ).

- In expressions:
  Use: lv_cleaned = condense( lv_raw ) directly inside assignments.

Example 1:

Input:
CONDENSE lv_name.

Output:
*CONDENSE lv_name.                          "Commented By PwA  Rule 19
lv_name = condense( lv_name ).             "Added By PwA  Rule 19

Example 2:

Input:
DATA lv_result TYPE string.
lv_result = lv_input.
CONDENSE lv_result.

Output:
DATA lv_result TYPE string.
lv_result = lv_input.
*CONDENSE lv_result.                        "Commented By PwA  Rule 19
lv_result = condense( lv_result ).         "Added By PwA  Rule 19



Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| CONDENSE used as a statement | Replace with assignment using condense( ) |
| Inline assignment or usage | Preferred for modern ABAP |
| Commenting | Always comment the old CONDENSE and add corrected version |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---
Rule 20: Replace TRANSLATE TO UPPER/LOWER with to_upper( ) and to_lower( )

Description:
- In modern ABAP (S/4HANA), use the functional expressions `to_upper( )` and `to_lower( )` instead of the procedural `TRANSLATE ... TO UPPER/LOWER CASE`.
- This enables expression-based programming and improves readability and performance.
- Especially useful within VALUE, LOOP, and method calls.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  TRANSLATE lv_name TO UPPER CASE.
  With:
  lv_name = to_upper( lv_name ).

  TRANSLATE lv_name TO LOWER CASE.
  With:
  lv_name = to_lower( lv_name ).

Example 1: To Uppercase

Input:
TRANSLATE lv_matnr TO UPPER CASE.

Output:
*TRANSLATE lv_matnr TO UPPER CASE.        "Commented By PwA  Rule 20
lv_matnr = to_upper( lv_matnr ).          "Added By PwA  Rule 20

Example 2: To Lowercase

Input:
TRANSLATE lv_email TO LOWER CASE.

Output:
*TRANSLATE lv_email TO LOWER CASE.        "Commented By PwA  Rule 20
lv_email = to_lower( lv_email ).          "Added By PwA  Rule 20


Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| TRANSLATE TO UPPER CASE | Replace with to_upper( ) |
| TRANSLATE TO LOWER CASE | Replace with to_lower( ) |
| Inline assignments | Already compliant — no change needed |
| Commenting | Comment old TRANSLATE and add corrected version |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---

Rule 21: Replace READ TABLE with line_exists( ) for Existence Checks

Description:
- When checking for the existence of a row in an internal table using `READ TABLE ... TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS`,
  modern ABAP recommends using the `line_exists( )` expression.
- It simplifies code, improves readability, and allows inline use within IF, CASE, and LOOP expressions.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  READ TABLE lt_table WITH KEY field = value TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.
  IF sy-subrc = 0.
  With:
  IF line_exists( lt_table[ field = value ] ).

- This is purely for existence check. Use full `READ TABLE ... INTO` if you need data access.

Example 1:

Input:
READ TABLE lt_mara WITH KEY matnr = lv_matnr TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.
IF sy-subrc = 0.
  "Do something
ENDIF.

Output:
*READ TABLE lt_mara WITH KEY matnr = lv_matnr TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.   "Commented By PwA  Rule 21
*IF sy-subrc = 0.                                                       "Commented By PwA  Rule 21
IF line_exists( lt_mara[ matnr = lv_matnr ] ).                         "Added By PwA  Rule 21
  "Do something
ENDIF.

Example 2: Nested Check

Input:
READ TABLE lt_vbak WITH KEY vbeln = lv_vbeln TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.
IF sy-subrc = 0 AND lv_flag = abap_true.
  "logic
ENDIF.

Output:
*READ TABLE lt_vbak WITH KEY vbeln = lv_vbeln TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS.   "Commented By PwA  Rule 21
*IF sy-subrc = 0 AND lv_flag = abap_true.                                "Commented By PwA  Rule 21
IF line_exists( lt_vbak[ vbeln = lv_vbeln ] ) AND lv_flag = abap_true.  "Added By PwA  Rule 21
  "logic
ENDIF.

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| READ TABLE ... TRANSPORTING NO FIELDS for existence check | Replace with line_exists( itab[ key = val ] ) |
| Read with INTO work area | Keep using READ TABLE |
| Commenting | Comment old READ + sy-subrc logic and replace with line_exists |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |
---

Rule 22: Replace Untyped FIELD-SYMBOLS TYPE ANY with Properly Typed FIELD-SYMBOLS

Description:
- In legacy ABAP, FIELD-SYMBOLS were often declared with TYPE ANY, which weakens type safety and code readability.
- In S/4HANA and modern ABAP, always use explicit types with FIELD-SYMBOLS to ensure static type checking and clarity.
- Use `TYPE <structure>` or find the referenced line type of <internal_tble> and write `TYPE  <internal_table>` when applicable.

Best Practices:
- Replace:
  FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE ANY.
  With:
  FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs> TYPE <actual_type>.

Example 1: Structure Reference

Input:
FIELD-SYMBOLS <ls_mara> TYPE ANY.

Output:
*FIELD-SYMBOLS <ls_mara> TYPE ANY.              "Commented By PwA  Rule 22
FIELD-SYMBOLS <ls_mara> TYPE mara.              "Added By PwA  Rule 22

Example 2: Line of Internal Table

Input:
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_line> TYPE ANY.
ASSIGN lt_mara[ 1 ] TO <fs_line>.

Output:
*FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_line> TYPE ANY.              "Commented By PwA  Rule 22
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_line> TYPE  mara.             "Added By PwA  Rule 22
ASSIGN lt_mara[ 1 ] TO <fs_line>.

Example 3: Using Declared TYPE

Input:
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_data,
         field1 TYPE i,
         field2 TYPE string,
       END OF ty_data.

FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_data> TYPE ANY.

Output:
TYPES: BEGIN OF ty_data,
         field1 TYPE i,
         field2 TYPE string,
       END OF ty_data.

*FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_data> TYPE ANY.              "Commented By PwA  Rule 22
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_data> TYPE ty_data.           "Added By PwA  Rule 22

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| FIELD-SYMBOLS TYPE ANY used | Replace with explicitly typed FIELD-SYMBOL declaration |
| Reference to internal tables | Use TYPE LINE OF <table> |
| Commenting | Always comment old TYPE ANY line and add typed version |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---

Rule 23: Replace CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT/OUTPUT' with Inline CONV or VALUE Logic

Description:
- In modern ABAP (especially S/4HANA), avoid using `CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT'` and `'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT'`.
- These are used for zero-padding (input) and stripping leading zeros (output) in fields like MATNR, KUNNR, etc.
- Prefer using `CONV` with appropriate data types or string functions for better performance and readability.

Best Practices:
- For ALPHA = IN (zero-padding), use:
  target = CONV matnr( source ).

- For ALPHA = OUT (strip leading zeros), use:
  target = |{ source ALPHA = OUT }| or simply apply string operations (e.g., `SHIFT` or `REPLACE`) when applicable.

Example 1: ALPHA = IN

Input:
CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT'
  EXPORTING input  = lv_matnr
  IMPORTING output = lv_matnr.

Output:
*CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_INPUT'                   "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  EXPORTING input  = lv_matnr                                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  IMPORTING output = lv_matnr.                                "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
lv_matnr = CONV matnr( lv_matnr ).                             "Added By PwA  Rule 23

Example 2: ALPHA = OUT

Input:
CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT'
  EXPORTING input  = lv_matnr
  IMPORTING output = lv_display.

Output:
*CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT'                  "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  EXPORTING input  = lv_matnr                                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  IMPORTING output = lv_display.                              "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
lv_display = |{ lv_matnr ALPHA = OUT }|.                       "Added By PwA  Rule 23

Example 3: Inline Output Removal

Input:
lv_text = lv_matnr.
CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT'
  EXPORTING input = lv_text
  IMPORTING output = lv_text.

Output:
lv_text = lv_matnr.
*CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ALPHA_OUTPUT'                  "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  EXPORTING input = lv_text                                   "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
*  IMPORTING output = lv_text.                                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 23
lv_text = |{ lv_text ALPHA = OUT }|.                           "Added By PwA  Rule 23

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| CALL FUNCTION for ALPHA = IN | Replace with CONV <domain>( var ) |
| CALL FUNCTION for ALPHA = OUT | Replace with string template ALPHA = OUT or REPLACE SHIFT |
| Commenting | Always comment full FUNCTION block and add simplified expression |
| Tagging | Always include Rule Number in comments |

---
Rule 24: Comment Out Unused DATA, INTERNAL TABLES, FIELD SYMBOLS, and WORK AREAS

Description:
- In ABAP programs, any declared `DATA`, `FIELD-SYMBOLS`, `CONSTANTS`, `TYPES`, internal tables, or work areas 
  that are not used anywhere in the program should be commented out.
- This improves readability, reduces memory footprint, and helps avoid confusion in code maintenance and review.
- The check should be based on static usage in the program (excluding dynamic usage or field-symbol dereferencing).

Best Practices:
- Detect all declarations that are not statically referenced in:
  - Executable statements
  - Control logic (IF, CASE, LOOP, READ, etc.)
  - Method/function/module calls
- Comment out these unused declarations with a clear tag.

Example 1: Unused Local Variable

Input:
DATA lv_matnr TYPE matnr.
" No usage in code

Output:
*DATA lv_matnr TYPE matnr.                      "Commented By PwA  Rule 24

Example 2: Unused Internal Table

Input:
DATA lt_kna1 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF kna1.
" Not used anywhere

Output:
*DATA lt_kna1 TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF kna1.      "Commented By PwA  Rule 24

Example 3: Unused FIELD-SYMBOLS

Input:
FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_kna1> TYPE kna1.
" Not assigned or dereferenced

Output:
*FIELD-SYMBOLS <fs_kna1> TYPE kna1.             "Commented By PwA  Rule 24

Example 4: Unused Work Area

Input:
DATA ls_mara TYPE mara.
" Not referenced anywhere

Output:
*DATA ls_mara TYPE mara.                        "Commented By PwA  Rule 24

Example 5: Used Variables (no change)

Input:
DATA lv_matnr TYPE matnr.
lv_matnr = '1000001'.

(No change needed — variable is used)

Summary Table:

| Scenario | Action |
|:---------|:-------|
| Variable/Table/FS declared but never used | Comment out with tag |
| Variable is used in code | Leave intact |
| Dynamic usage or macro expansion | Should be handled with caution or optionally excluded |
| Commenting | Always add "Commented By PwA  Rule 24" tag |

---

Rule 25: Replace DIVIDE and MULTIPLY Statements with Arithmetic Expressions

Description:
- In ABAP programs, the usage of DIVIDE and MULTIPLY statements is considered outdated and less readable.
- Use direct assignment (=) with arithmetic operators (*, /) instead, which is more concise and in line with modern ABAP standards.
- Replacing these statements improves code clarity and simplifies maintenance.

Best Practices:
- Identify any use of the following procedural arithmetic commands:
  - DIVIDE <val1> BY <val2>.
  - DIVIDE <val1> BY <val2> INTO <target>.
  - MULTIPLY <val1> BY <val2>.
  - MULTIPLY <val1> BY <val2> INTO <target>.
- Replace these with direct arithmetic expressions:
  - <val1> = <val1> / <val2>.
  - <target> = <val1> / <val2>.
  - <val1> = <val1> * <val2>.
  - <target> = <val1> * <val2>.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity by using standard mathematical operators in assignment statements.

Example 1: DIVIDE with Overwrite

Input:
DIVIDE lv_total BY lv_count.

Output:
lv_total = lv_total / lv_count.                "Remediated By PwA  Rule 25

Example 2: DIVIDE INTO a Target Variable

Input:
DIVIDE lv_total BY lv_count INTO lv_avg.

Output:
lv_avg = lv_total / lv_count.                  "Remediated By PwA  Rule 25

Example 3: MULTIPLY with Overwrite

Input:
MULTIPLY lv_net BY lv_rate.

Output:
lv_net = lv_net * lv_rate.                     "Remediated By PwA  Rule 25

Example 4: MULTIPLY INTO a Target Variable

Input:
MULTIPLY lv_length BY lv_width INTO lv_area.

Output:
lv_area = lv_length * lv_width.                "Remediated By PwA  Rule 25

Example 5: Already in Recommended Format (No Change)

Input:
lv_area = lv_length * lv_width.

Output:
(No change needed — expression already follows best practice)

Rule 26: Remove or Comment Out BREAK-POINT Statements from Production Code

Description:
- BREAK-POINT statements are used for debugging during development but should not remain in production code.
- They interrupt program execution and can cause unintended behavior in live systems.
- To ensure code quality and avoid disruptions, all BREAK-POINT statements must be either removed or commented out before transport to QA or production environments.

Best Practices:
- Identify any instance of the statement:
  - BREAK-POINT.
  - BREAK <username>.
- If found in development code, comment it out or delete it entirely.
- Add a comment explaining removal, such as: "Commented By PwA  Rule 26"
- BREAK statements should not be present in finalized transports.

Example 1: Simple BREAK-POINT

Input:
BREAK-POINT.

Output:
*BREAK-POINT.                                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 26

Example 2: BREAK with username

Input:
BREAK SAPUSER.

Output:
*BREAK SAPUSER.                                "Commented By PwA  Rule 26

Example 3: Already commented BREAK-POINT (No Change)

Input:
*BREAK-POINT.

Output:
(No change needed — already commented out)

Example 4: Conditional BREAK-POINT (development debugging, must be removed)

Input:
IF lv_debug = abap_true.
  BREAK-POINT.
ENDIF.

Output:
IF lv_debug = abap_true.
*  BREAK-POINT.                                "Commented By PwA  Rule 26
ENDIF.

Summary Table:

| Scenario                         | Action                                 |

Rule 28: Ensure Proper Definition of VBTYP-Related Variables for S/4HANA Compatibility

Description:
- In ECC, the VBTYP domain (Sales Document Category) is defined with a length of 1 character.
- In S/4HANA, this domain has been extended to 4 characters to accommodate new document types.
- Any custom variable that holds VBTYP values must be defined using the correct domain or a compatible data element.
- Failure to use the extended definition can lead to truncation, incorrect value comparison, inconsistent message generation, and file structure misalignment during data transfer or interface processing.

Best Practices:
- Detect variables that are intended to store VBTYP values but are defined using incorrect or shorter types (e.g., `TYPE c LENGTH 1`, `TYPE char1`, or implicit character types).
- Refactor the definition of these variables using the appropriate dictionary reference, such as:
  - `TYPE vbtyp`
  - `TYPE <data element referencing domain VBTYP>`
- Ensure the variable length is at least 4 characters if domain reference is not used directly.
- Pay special attention to interface fields, message structures, file layouts, and MOVE statements where data loss might occur due to incorrect typing.

Example 1: Incorrect Declaration

Input:
DATA lv_vbtyp TYPE c LENGTH 1.

Output:
*DATA lv_vbtyp TYPE c LENGTH 1.                  "Commented By PwA  Rule 28
DATA lv_vbtyp TYPE vbtyp.                        "Remediated By PwA  Rule 28

Example 2: Implicitly Incorrect Typing

Input:
DATA: lv_type(1) TYPE c.

Output:
*DATA: lv_type(1) TYPE c.                         "Commented By PwA  Rule 28
DATA lv_type TYPE vbtyp.                          "Remediated By PwA  Rule 28

Example 3: Correct VBTYP Declaration (No Change)

Input:
DATA lv_doc_category TYPE vbtyp.

Output:
(No change needed — already using domain reference)

Example 4: MOVE to Short Variable (Potential Data Loss)

Input:
MOVE lv_vbtyp TO lv_short_char. " lv_short_char TYPE c LENGTH 1

Output:
*MOVE lv_vbtyp TO lv_short_char.                 "Commented By PwA  Rule 28
MOVE lv_vbtyp TO lv_short_char_ext.              "Remediated By PwA  Rule 28 (Ensure length >= 4 or domain-based)

Summary Table:

| Scenario                                                  | Action                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Variable used for VBTYP but defined as char1 or c(1)       | Redefine using vbtyp or appropriate domain type   |
| Implicit character declaration for VBTYP usage             | Replace with domain-based data element            |
| Move statement to a shorter variable                      | Comment and replace with length-compliant field   |
| Already using TYPE vbtyp or domain-compliant type         | Leave unchanged                                   |
| In interfaces, IDocs, file fields holding VBTYP            | Ensure they support 4-character domain            |
| Commenting or remediation tag                              | Add "Commented By PwA  Rule 28" / "Remediated ..." |

Rule 29:

Description:
- Avoid using `SELECT SINGLE *` in ABAP as it reads all fields from the table, which is inefficient and may break if table structure changes.
- Instead, select only required fields explicitly.
- Also, use `INTO @DATA(...)` or `INTO @<work_area>` for modern and safe field assignment.

Best Practices:
- Identify the required fields and replace `*` with the field list.
- Use inline declaration or properly typed work area for the selected record.

Example 1:

Input:
SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara INTO wa_mara.

Output:
*SELECT SINGLE * FROM mara INTO wa_mara.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 29
SELECT SINGLE matnr, ersda, mtart FROM mara INTO @wa_mara.  "Added By PwA  Rule 29

Example 2:

Input:
SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbak INTO @DATA(ls_vbak).

Output:
*SELECT SINGLE * FROM vbak INTO @DATA(ls_vbak).  "Commented By PwA  Rule 29
SELECT SINGLE vbeln, erdat, auart FROM vbak INTO @DATA(ls_vbak).  "Added By PwA  Rule 29

Summary Table:

| Scenario                      | Action                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `SELECT SINGLE *` usage      | Replace with specific fields                         |
| INTO statement               | Use `INTO @DATA(...)` or typed work area            |
| Commenting                   | Always comment original line and add modified one   |
| Tagging                      | Always include Rule Number in comments              |

Rule 30:(Mandatory)

Description:
- Avoid using `LOOP AT <itab>` as header lines are obsolete in S/4HANA.
- Use inline data declarations and explicitly typed work areas for better readability and clean code.
- Replace field references from `<itab>-field` to `<wa>-field` inside the loop.

Best Practices:
- Replace `LOOP AT <itab>` with `LOOP AT <itab> INTO DATA(<wa>)`.
- Use meaningful inline variables (e.g., `ls_<name>`).
- Update all field references inside the loop accordingly.
- Always comment the original code and tag with rule number.

Example 1:

Input:
LOOP AT it_mara.
  WRITE: / it_mara-matnr.
ENDLOOP.

Output:
*LOOP AT it_mara .  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
*  WRITE: / it_mara-matnr.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
LOOP AT it_mara INTO DATA(ls_mara).  "Added By PwA  Rule 30
  WRITE: / ls_mara-matnr.  "Updated By PwA  Rule 30
ENDLOOP.

Example 2:

Input:
LOOP AT it_vbak.
  lv_auart = it_vbak-auart.
  lv_vkorg = it_vbak-vkorg.
ENDLOOP.

Output:
*LOOP AT it_vbak.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
*  lv_auart = it_vbak-auart.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
*  lv_vkorg = it_vbak-vkorg.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
LOOP AT it_vbak INTO DATA(ls_vbak).  "Added By PwA  Rule 30
  lv_auart = ls_vbak-auart.  "Updated By PwA  Rule 30
  lv_vkorg = ls_vbak-vkorg.  "Updated By PwA  Rule 30

Example 3:

Input:
LOOP AT it_vbak.
  LOOP AT it_vbap WITH HEADER LINE.
    WRITE: / it_vbak-vbeln, it_vbap-posnr.
  ENDLOOP.
ENDLOOP.

Output:
*LOOP AT it_vbak.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
*  LOOP AT it_vbap WITH HEADER LINE.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
*    WRITE: / it_vbak-vbeln, it_vbap-posnr.  "Commented By PwA  Rule 30
